# Product Sales Network Visualization

This project visualizes a product sales network using a force-based layout to identify popular products and well-connected stores. The visualization is implemented using Python with the `NetworkX` and `Matplotlib` libraries, as part of **Task 6** for designing and performing visualization for graphs and networks.

## Objective
The goal is to create a graph-based visualization of a sales network where:
- Nodes represent products and stores.
- Edges represent sales connections between products and stores.
- A force-based layout (spring layout) is used to arrange the nodes for clear visualization.

This project aligns with the course objective **CO3, S3** and uses Python for implementation.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `networkx`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib
